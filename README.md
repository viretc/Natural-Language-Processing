# Natural Language Processing

## Real and Fake news

Project made with my classmate Alexandre Olivier during our master’s in business Analytics and Big Data at IE school of human science and technology.

Binary classification of real and fake tweets using NLTK pre-processing and divers machine learning algorithms such as SDG classifier, Linear SVM, PassiveAgressive etc.

Best in sample score 93.5% accuracy – Out of sample score unknown (keep hidden by the professor, but according to his feedback we were on the top 5% of the class).

Note: the aim was to use NLTK pipeline for the text pre-processing and we were not allowed to use more “advance” technics such as LSTM or other Deep learning architectures for this project.
